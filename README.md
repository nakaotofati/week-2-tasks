# week-2-tasks
I've created three circuits each with a different motor; Servo motor , stepper motor , and the brushless motor
the brushless motor is the main task in this week , and the task was to learn how to connect the brushless motor with the Arduino UNO and the wesdom ESP32 controllers but we used "Tinkercad" to create the circuit and I couldn't find the ESP32 controller so, I used a different controller in order to turn on the motor
