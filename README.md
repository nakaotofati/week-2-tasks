I've created three circuits each with a different motor; Servo motor , stepper motor , and the brushless motor
the brushless motor is the main task in this week ,so I've used tinkercad to create the circits and I uplaod the links in the projects section 
I've also used proteus 8.1 to create the Brushless motor circuit
